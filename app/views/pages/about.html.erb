    <h3>About The Firepit</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this web application is to allow users to create and participate in focused intimate discussions on specific topics created by the user. Firepits will not stay lit on their own. The lifeblood of any firepit is kindling. As so with a physical firepit so goes the digital firepit. Kindling will be provided in the form of votes. If the discussion is interesting enough then the fire will stay lit. Pits with no attention and care will go out in the physical world as well as here within this application. Social media apps like facebook are nice for this in some ways, particularly with the "groups" feature. However, I find that something more geared and specific is needed for some people like myself and others that I know. The aim is really to eliminate uneeded banter and argumentation that goes nowhere. Negative commentary will be downvoted and put out. Stimulating conversation on the other hand will do the opposite and feed the fire. Other web apps certainly allow for good discussion but there is little to stop a good discussion from going bad which is far often the case. I'm hoping that this application can curb some of the issues you commonly see in other like applications around the internet.</p>

    <p> This idea is not my own and was spurned by many real life firepit discussions around a real fire. The participants of those discussions found it was the perfect environment to discuss a great many ideas, both complex and simple at great length, without conflict amongst people who often didn't agree with each other.</p>
